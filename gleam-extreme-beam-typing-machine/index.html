# Gleam: Extreme BEAM typing machine

## Louis Pilfold<br>@louispilfold

???

I'm Louis

Founder of small company called Waive

Using Elixir and Erlang for 4-5 years. I do a lot of open source work.

One of my first projects was Dogma, an Elixir style linter.

After that I made mix test.watch, which is a mix plugin that will
automatically run your ExUnit tests when you save a file.

And then after that I made exfmt, which was an Elixir auto-formatter.

I've also done some work inside the Elixir compiler, for example I taught the
inspect protocol about colours so that there would be syntax highlighting in
the REPL.

I'm here to talk about Gleam, which has been my focus for the last year.

What is Gleam?

---

## Hello, Gleam!

```rust
pub enum LinkedList(a) =
  | Nil
  | Cons(a, LinkedList(a))

pub fn contains(list, a) {
  case list {
  | Nil -> False
  | Cons(x, xs) -> x == a || contains(xs, a)
  }
}
```

???

Gleam is a language that like Elixir runs on the BEAM (Erlang VM).

Has curly braces, which ReasonML has shown is really important if you want
people to actually use your language

But more importantly it has a robust type system inspired by the ML family of
languages.

# Why a new language?

???
A good place to start.

Why have I wasted the last year of my life doing this when we have Elixir and
Erlang?

To understand this let's take a look at Elixir and Erlang.

Who here considers themselves an Elixir user?

Who is new to Elixir?

Who has never used Elixir?

# What are BEAM languages good at?

## Concurrency

<img class="center-element" src="lyse-sequential-accept.png">
<br>
<img class="center-element" src="lyse-parallel-accept.png">

???

When we write programs in Elixir and Erlang we can take advantage of the
concurrency features of the virtual machine.

Here we have 2 diagrams that I've stolen from LYSE.

They show how a hypothetical web server application. It listens and accepts
requests as fast as possible.

What impact does concurrency have on the performance of the web server?

---
## Without concurrency
<img class="center-element" src="time-serial.png">

???

Here's a graph showing how the requests are handled over time.

4 requests are made to the server at the same time.

The first request is handled, then the second, then the third, then the
fourth.

The time taken to handle all the requests is equal to the sum of the time
taken by each request.

---
## Without concurrency
<img class="center-element" src="time-serial-slow.png">

???

What happens when one request is slow and takes more time than we would like?

All requests that come after the slow request have to wait for it to complete
before they can be processed.

The latency of all following requests is effected by this one request, and
your overall latency suffers.


---
## With concurrency
<img class="center-element" src="time-concurrent.png">

???

So what about when the web server handles requests concurrently?

Here each request is handled in a dedicated light-weight virtual machine
thread that in the Erlang world we call a process.

Other languages have other abstractions, but we use processes.

When 4 requests come in at the same time each one is handled by a dedicated
process, each running at the same time.

The total time taken is now equal to the time taken by the slowest request


There is a smll overhead for the concurrency abstraction, but it is dwarfed by
the gains here.

---
## With concurrency
<img class="center-element" src="time-concurrent-slow.png">

???

What happens when one request is slow?

Because all the processes are independent it doesn't matter if one is slow- no
others are delayed.

Every other request completes in a timely fashion, and our overall performance
remains good.

Concurrency is a wonderful tool for writing software the performs well, and
Elixir and Erlang gives us the means to make concurrent programs without too
many headaches.


---
class: middle, center, slide-blue
# Concurrency <br> vs <br> parallelism

???
<!-- 6 mins since start -->

I want to quickly talk about the relationship between concurrency and
parallelism. What's the difference?

---
## Without parallelism

<img style="width: 80%" class="center-element" src="single-core.png">
???

With concurrency each item of work is taking place at the same time, but the
CPU might only be performing one task at any one moment.

Most the time each item of work may be waiting on IO, waiting for data to come
in off a socket, waiting for data to be written to disc, so the CPU isn't
always needed.

Because of this we can share the CPU between many Erlang processes, switching
to whichever is needed at that moment.

---
## With parallelism

<img style="width: 80%" class="center-element" src="multi-core.png">
???

A step up from thing single threaded concurrency is parallelism.

If we have a CPU with multiple cores we can actually compute multiple things
at the very same time.

Here we've gone from 1 blue core being shared, we've also got a green core and
a pink one, speeding up the CPU bound part of our program as well as the IO
parts.

Why is this especially important now?


---
## Parallelism

<img style="width: 90%" class="center-element" src="core-over-time.jpg">

<cite>
Nikos Hardavellas,
Northwestern University, EECS
</cite>

???

This graph shows the number of cores per CPU from the 70s up until a
couple years ago, and that number is increasing exponentially.

CPU are no longer getting faster, instead they are getting more cores, so if
we want our programs to get faster as hardware improves we need our programs
to be able to make full use of all these cores.

For BEAM languages this is not a problem. If we write our program to be
concurrent the virtual machine will auto-magically turn it into a parallel one
by spreading the processes across all of the CPU cores.

If we have 4 cores, our program should run 4 times faster with little to no
effort.


---
## Predictable garbage collection

<img class="center-element" src="garbage-collection.jpg">

???

This is the BEAM's garbage collector.

It's adorable, but more importantly is also parallel. Garbage collection is
performed on a per-process basis.

This means your program will never decide it's time to do global garbage
collection and pause the world, introducing a big chunk of latency to, say,
all the requests made to your web application.

And what's more because GC doesn't occur until after the process has been
around for a little, if you use a new process for each item of work you may
never hit GC in the hot path.

Latency in Erlang and Elixir tends to be predictable with low deviation.


---
## Fault tolerance

<img class="center-element" src="bugs.jpg">

???

There are lots of other languages that offer concurrency, parallelism, and
low latency garbage collection, but this feature really sets the BEAM apart
from the rest.

What's the industry standard way of dealing with bugs, mistakes, and other
things that may make a program crash?

We try to make sure it doesn't happen. We find all the bugs and remove them.

Turns out this is really difficult, so maybe would we use automated tests to
find them, but if we make a mistake in the tests then bugs can slip though.

## Preventing failure

<img style="width: 50%; float: right" src="sisyphus.png">

<style type="text/css" media="screen">
.bug-list li {
  padding-bottom: 10px;
}
</style>

1. Example tests
   <br>EUnit, ExUnit
2. Property tests
   <br>QuickCheck
3. Weak type systems
   <br>Java, C, Go, etc
4. Stronger type systems
   <br>Haskell, Elm, etc
5. Formal verification
   <br>Idris, Agda, Coq

???

If we're clever we might use a tool like QuickCheck to generate vast numbers
of test cases based around the desired properties of our program, finding bugs
in edge cases we wouldn't have otherwise considered.

Static type systems are capable of preventing entire classes of bugs from
programs, especially stronger ones found in languages like Elm and Haskell.

Even then the type systems are not expressive enough to verify that the
program is error free.

After that we could write proofs that verify that our program has the correct
behaviour. This is incredibly powerful and could be the future of programming,
but today it's difficult and time consuming.

It's very difficult to write bug free code.

---
## We can't win

<img style="width: 77%;" class="center-element" src="oops.png">

???

Even if somehow we made our code bug free we can't escape error.

What if there's a bug in the language runtime?

What if we run out of memory?

What if there's a bug in the operating system?

What if there's a hardware failure and our program gets subtly corrupted?

What if cosmic radiation causes some bits in RAM to flip from 0 to 1?

What if our computer is struck by a bolt of lighting?

Avoiding failure is impossible, and most languages ignore this fact.

---
## Processes to the rescue

<img style="width: 77%;" class="center-element" src="process-crash.png">

???

How do BEAM languages tackle this problem? With processes again.

Processes act as failure bulkheads. If there is an unexpected error then only
the process that has the problem crashes, not the entire program. All over
processes continue as normal.

Because of this when errors inevitably happen only the sub-system that has the
problem will be effected, everything else can remain functional and our
service can stay up.

In a well structured program every process has a supervisor process watching
over it which is responsible for restarting the failed process in a
configurable fashion. Turning it off and on again at on a micro-level.

Using this we can build systems that self heal, incrementally shedding of
state until the problem has been resolved.


---
## More good stuff
- Simple functional programming

???

This one is very much a matter of opinion, but I think the simple style of
functional programming in Elixir and Erlang is one of the easier programming
styles to learn and work with.

---
## More good stuff
- Simple functional programming
- Immutable data

???

Almost all data on the BEAM is immutable.

This is great because immutable data is easier to reason about then mutable
data as it can't change unexpected.

It also has some really performance characteristics that we take full
advantage of in common Elixir programming patterns.

---
## More good stuff
- Simple functional programming
- Immutable data
- Good libraries and tooling

???

Elixir and Erlang are relatively niche languages, yet they have a healthy
ecosystem of libraries hosted on hex, the package manager.

Everything you probably want for running a professional web application is
there, complete with documentation and active maintainers.


---
## More good stuff
- Simple functional programming
- Immutable data
- Good libraries and tooling
- Dynamic programming

???

Elixir and Erlang are dynamically typed, which can really help us get code
written and shipped as fast as possible.

What's more compiled code can be dynamically loaded into the virtual machine,
giving us ways to debug, introspect, and update our programs while they are
still running.

---
## More good stuff
- Simple functional programming
- Immutable data
- Good libraries and tooling
- Dynamic programming
- Meta programming

???

Using meta programming to generate code at compile time is common in BEAM
languages.

It can be used to create concise domain specific languages, such as the ones
used in the Phoenix web framework or the Absinthe GraphQL framework, but my
favourite use of it is to move expensive computation to compile time.

If some operation is expensive but can be safely cached, just do it on your CI
server and store the result in a module.

This is how the Elixir String module works, it's generated from the unicode
database.

---
## More good stuff
- Simple functional programming
- Immutable data
- Good libraries and tooling
- Dynamic programming
- Meta programming
- Interoperability between languages

???

This one is a favourite of mine. It's very easy for one BEAM language to make
use of code written in another BEAM langauge.

For example, if we're writing Elixir and we want a queue data structure, we
can just use the Erlang queue module. There's no ceremony required, and no
performance overhead.

If someone were to **make a new language** on the BEAM the users of this new
language would be able to take advantage of all the existing libraries on
offer.


---
## More good stuff
- Simple functional programming
- Immutable data
- Good libraries and tooling
- Dynamic programming
- Meta programming
- Interoperability between languages
- A friendly community

???

This one is important to me.

The community BEAM languages once had a reputation for being closed and
impenetrable, but these days that's certainly not the case.

We've got books, great documentation, tutorials, forums, slack channels, IRC,
meetups, conferences, workshops, and more. It's easier than ever to learn
these languages and to interact with people in the community.


---

# What are they not quite as good at?

???

Now that I've wasted a bunch of time telling a room of Elixir users that
Elixir is good let's look at bunch of things that could be improved.

The aspect I'm particularly interested is how they present feedback to the
programmer when a mistake has been made.

I think that improvements in this area could bring great value and
productivity for relatively low cost.

Let's take a closer look.


---
class: bug-list
## Failure is frequent

<img style="width: 50%; float: right" src="ouch.png">

1. Example tests
   <br>EUnit, ExUnit
2. Property tests (???)
   <br>QuickCheck
3. ~~Weak type systems
   <br>Java, C, Go, etc~~
4. ~~Stronger type systems
   <br>Haskell, Elm, etc~~
5. ~~Formal verification
   <br>Idris, Agda, Coq~~

???

I talked previously about how processes give us a way to handle failure
as gracefully as possible, but that doesn't mean that failure isn't a problem.

When something going wrong you're still going to get paged at 4 in the morning
and it's still your job to fix it.

These methods for removing failure are not perfect, but they will decrease how
frequently you get paged, and realistically in Elixir we only really use
example tests.

NoRedInk is a company that uses a lot of the Elm language, and they claim that
in 2 years they have only had one runtime error, and that was because of
unsafe Javascript interop.

Type systems really help here.


---
class: center
## Error messages can be unhelpful

<img src="elixir-argument-error.png">

???

Error messages leave a lot to be desired.

Here we have an error being printed after we call the function `MyApp.name` on
a string.

Many Elixir error messages are better than this one but it is not an atypical
example for Elixir, and it is the norm for Erlang. I'm going to focus on
common cases that could be improved.

Beyond the name "argument error" it doesn't tell us what the problem is.

It shows a call to `erlang.atom_to_binary` so we can establish that the
application crashes at this point, but where is the source of the error?

Have we called `MyApp.name` with the wrong argument? Perhaps it wants and atom
rather than a string.

Alternatively is the `MyApp` module internally inconsistent? Does it have a
bug? We could be using it as intended but the code we're calling is the source
of the problem?

There's no way to tell without reading the documentation, the source code, or
if we get unlucky, both.

---
class: center
## Meanwhile, in Elm
<img src="elm-error.png">
<br>

???

Here's how the same problem would be reported in the Elm programming language.

It tells us exactly where the problem is, it's on line 8 where we called
`MyApp.name`. It even shows us the code.

This is fantastic- we know exactly where we need to make the change, it's
where we called the function.

With this feedback we have complete confidence that the `MyApp.name` function
is not the problem, so we don't need to investigate further.

If there was a problem with `MyApp.name` this error would show exactly where,
so even in scenario all we would need to do is to open the right file and
scroll to the specified line.

What's the problem? We're it with a String when it expects an Int.

It even gives us a hint of how to turn an Int into a String.



---
## Refactoring

<img class="center-element" src="refactoring.png">

???

Refactoring in Elixir is far more time consuming than I want it to be.

1. We make a change to our code. Perhaps we've decided to add a new field to a
   map data structure.
2. Find all the places this change effects. Everywhere this map is constructed
   and a subset of the places the map is consumed needs to be located by the
   programer.
3. Once we know all the locations we update them to fit the new design.
4. And then we update the tests for all these places to ensure they handle the
   new data appropriately.

Finding the problems is hard and time consuming. Tests help, but as we've said
before they are not completely effective, the rest is up to the programmer.

I want the compiler to find all these problems for me, so all I have to do is
decide what to do about them.

Writing tests is also time consuming. The Elixir application I work on at
Waive has more test code than application code, and it takes a lot of time
time to maintain these tests.

If the compiler was capable of verifying certain properties of my program I
would need to verify them myself with tests. With a robust type system we can
write a faction of the tests and have an increase in test coverage.


---
## When is the bug found?

<img class="center-element" src="flow.png">

???

When a mistake is made how long before the bug is discovered?

It could be in dev or in the tests, in which case you'll find out in seconds
or minutes.

Perhaps it's found when a peer reviews your code, or during QA? This could be
minutes or hours later.

Maybe it's not discovered until the code is in production, in which case there
could be days before it is discovered.

It's hard to debug a problem when the context is days in size. As much as
possible I want any issues highlighted within a second of pressing save, and
with a well designed type system we can do that for most problems.


---
class: large-code
## What will this do?

<br>
```ruby
queue = QueueLib.append(queue, 10)
```

???

What will this function do?

Could it throw an exception?

Does it have some secret internal state or write to a database?

Could it cause the program to exit?

Could it be secretly phoning home? Letting the developer know you are using
their library.

Can we even rely on the return value? Will it always return the value we
expect, or will it do something else on Christmas day?

Could it start using your production server to mine bitcoin?

The only way to know if to read the source code of all the libraries you use,
and to read the source code for every update they get.

Do you do this?

It would be great if the language could tell us properties about code before
we use it. This would enable us to make informed decisions about deps.

  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="purescript.png">
  </div>
</div>

???

Of all the languages I know of I think these languages solve these problems
the best.

They are the ML family of languages, and their most notable feature is their
expressive and safe type systems.

---
class: middle
<img class="center-element" src="venn-beam-ml.png">

???

Here you can see BEAM languages with their set of strengths

and ML languages with their set of strengths

What I really want is a language that sits across the two and borrows the best
traits from both.


---

<img class="center-element" src="venn-gleam.png">

???

I hope that Gleam could achieve that goal.

In some respects it'll be lacking compared to Elixir and Erlang

in some respects it'll be lacking compared to OCaml and Purescript

But I think we can stand on their shoulders and build a really nice middle
ground.
