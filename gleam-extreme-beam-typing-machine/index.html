# Gleam: Extreme BEAM typing machine

## Louis Pilfold<br>@louispilfold

???

I'm Louis

Founder of Waive

Using Elixir and Erlang for 4-5 years.

Built dogma, exfmt, mix test.watch

Done some work inside the compiler

For the last year been working on Gleam

What is Gleam?

---

## Hello, Gleam!

```rust
pub enum LinkedList(a) =
  | Nil
  | Cons(a, LinkedList(a))

pub fn contains(list, a) {
  case list {
  | Nil -> False
  | Cons(x, xs) -> x == a || contains(xs, a)
  }
}
```

???

This is Gleam

Runs on the Erlang VM like Elixir

Has curly braces.

# Why a new language?

???
A good place to start.

Why have I wasted the last year of my life doing this when we have Elixir and
Erlang?

To understand this let's take a look at Elixir and Erlang.

Who here considers themselves an Elixir user?

Who is new to Elixir?

Who has never used Elixir?

# What are BEAM languages good at?

---
## Concurrency

---
## Parallelism

---
## Soft real-time performance

---
## Fault tolerance

---
## Simple functional programming

---
## Libraries and tooling

---
## Dynamic programming

---
## Meta programming

---
## Binary manipulation

---
## Interoperability between languages

---
## Community

# What are they not quite as good at?

???

Sadly Erlang and Elixir are not perfect

---
## Error messages can be unhelpful

---
## Refactoring isn't cheap

---
## Slow feedback cycle

???

We rely on unit tests to catch errors and mistakes

If that doesn't work we they might be found during manual testing

If that doesn't work we may find the mistake when processes crash in
production

class: large-code
## Hard to verify behaviour

<br>
```ruby
queue = QueueLib.append(queue, 10)
```

???

What will this function do?

Will it always return the same thing?

Could it throw an exception?

Could it write to the database?

Could it cause the program to exit?

---
## Which languages do these better?

<style type="text/css" media="screen">
.langs {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  align-items: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.langs div {
  display: inline-block;
  max-width: 40%;
  margin-top: 30px;
}

.langs img {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 150px;
}
</style>

<div class="langs">
