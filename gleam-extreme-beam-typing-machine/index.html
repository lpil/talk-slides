# Gleam: Extreme BEAM typing machine

## Louis Pilfold<br>@louispilfold

???

I'm Louis

Founder of Waive

Using Elixir and Erlang for 4-5 years.

Built dogma, exfmt, mix test.watch

Done some work inside the compiler

For the last year been working on Gleam

What is Gleam?

---

## Hello, Gleam!

```rust
pub enum LinkedList(a) =
  | Nil
  | Cons(a, LinkedList(a))

pub fn contains(list, a) {
  case list {
  | Nil -> False
  | Cons(x, xs) -> x == a || contains(xs, a)
  }
}
```

???

This is Gleam

Runs on the Erlang VM like Elixir

Has curly braces.

# Why a new language?

???
A good place to start.

Why have I wasted the last year of my life doing this when we have Elixir and
Erlang?

To understand this let's take a look at Elixir and Erlang.

Who here considers themselves an Elixir user?

Who is new to Elixir?

Who has never used Elixir?

---
## What're BEAM languages good at?

---
## What're they not so good at?

---
## Which languages are better at these?

Elm, OCaml, ReasonML, Haskell

Explain how they manage this

etc.

## Interested in making a language?

- go
- here

If you'd like to learn more about this algorithm check out the papers, they've
short, friendly, and easy to read.

Another good place to look is at the module `Inspect.Algebra` which implements
this algorithm with a slight twist.

Lastly you can check out `exfmt` on my GitHub account.
