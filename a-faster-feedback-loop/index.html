# A Faster Feedback Loop

Hi.

I'm Louis Pilfold, and I'm a exceptionally lazy developer.

class: center, middle

Write some unit tests<br>
Write some code<br>
Tests pass<br>
GOTO 10<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

???

This is my dev cycle.

I write a unit test.

I write some code.

The tests let me know if my implementation  has the
behaviour I expect.

For me this is much faster than checking in the REPL, and an
order of magnitude faster than actually running the app.

Write some unit tests<br>
Write some code<br>
Tests **FAIL**<br>
Write some code<br>
Tests pass<br>
GOTO 10<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

???

In reality it normally looks more like this.

I write some code. The test fails.

And again.

And so on.

Every time I write more code I have to switch to another window to run the
tests. As we've established, I'm very lazy, so I want to get the computer to
do it for me.

Most languages will have a tool that will automatically run your tests for you
each time you save a source file in your project, solving this problem.

Haskell has Stack.

Ruby has Guard.

Erlang has rebar autotest.

Javascript has Karma, Grunt, Gulp and so on.

But what did Elixir have back when v1.0 was new?

Nothing.

"I'll have to write one" I thought.

So I did. And I've been using it every day since.

I'm going to walk you through roughly how it works.

Hopefully at the end you'll have some thoughts as to how we can make it better.
