## Hi, I'm Louis!

???

Hello everyone! In 20 days I'm having my EU citizenship taken away, so welcome
to this limited edition European talk!

I'm Louis, and I've been a heavy user of Elixir and Erlang for about 5 years now.

I'm the founder of a small ad-tech company called Waive that uses Elixir for
everything, and I also do some open source work.

I wrote Dogma, a style linter for Elixir, later succeeded by Credo, which
we're going to hear about later from Rene.

After that I wrote mix test.watch, an automated test runner for Elixir, and
exfmt, an Elixir auto-formatter that was succeeded by the official formatter
released in Elixir v1.6.

I've also done some work inside the Elixir compiler. For example I taught the
inspect protocol about colours, and I used this to add syntax highlighting to
the iex.

But today I'm not here to talk about any of those things, I'm here to talk
about Gleam!

What is Gleam?

Gleam is a new functional programming language for the BEAM.

It is like Elixir in it compiles to Erlang and adds no runtime overhead, so it
should always be at least as performant as typical Elixir and Erlang code.

It's straightforward and zero cost to call Erlang and Elixir from Gleam, or to
call Gleam from Erlang and Elixir.

In this way Gleam aims to integrate well with other BEAM languages. We want to
enrichen and contribute to the BEAM ecosystem through collaboration, not
fracture it.

Possibly the most distinct and interesting of Gleam's features is it's type
system. Gleam has a strong static type system inspired by ML family languages
such as Haskell, Elm, and Rust. I think this type system is where most the
value of Gleam can be found.

# Why Gleam?
???

Here's the first question I want to answer- Why make a new language at all?
What's the point of Gleam?


---
class: middle
<img class="color-adjust center-element" src="img/the-beam.png">
???

A large part of the answer to that question is the BEAM, the Erlang virtual
machine.

The Erlang virtual machine is a fantastic piece of software and one of the
best language runtimes available today.

---
## Processes
<img class="color-adjust center-element" style="max-width: 90%" src="img/processes.png">
???

It has powerful concurrency features in the form of actor model.

With it we can spin up hundreds of thousands of lightweight threads called
processes inside our programs,

allowing us to make full use of modern computer processors,
which these days have more and more cores.

---
## Messages
<br>
<img class="color-adjust center-element" style="max-width: 90%" src="img/messages.png">
???

These processes communicate by sending messages to each other,

but what's amazing about this is that it doesn't matter if the processes are
running on the same instance of the BEAM, different instances of the BEAM on
the same computer, or even two completely different computers connected by a
network.

Distributed computing is built into the BEAM, a typical BEAM program written
in Erlang or Elixir can be turned into distributed program that runs on a
cluster of networked computers with minimal effort.

---
## Garbage collection
<img class="color-adjust center-element" src="img/garbage-collection.png">
???

Like most runtimes the BEAM offers garbage collection, however what makes it
unusual is that it is performed on a per-process basis.

This mean there is no stop-the-world pause for memory to be cleaned up,
so programs on the BEAM tend to have predictable and consistent low latency,
and can be thought as being soft real time.

---
## Fault tolerance
<img class="color-adjust center-element" src="img/isolation.png">
???

And perhaps most excitingly, Erlang processes act as error bulkheads, meaning
that when something does go wrong and your code crashes the problem is
contained to the smallest possible sub-system and will not impact any other
work being undertaken by the program.

An Erlang program that takes advantage of this property can self heal by
restarting the process and trying again, hopefully succeeding now that any
corrupt state has been shed.

In this way the BEAM is much like Kubernetes, the popular container
orchestrator from Google.

What makes the BEAM different from Kubernetes is that this state shedding can
happen at a much more fine grained level- we won't lose the state of the
entire program and all the requests being handled by it, instead just the
single process that had the problem.

---
## Why a new language?
<br>
<img class="center-element" src="img/beam-languages.png">
???

So yes, the BEAM is wonderful piece of technology to work with, and I'm sure
that you'll all understand why I wanted to use it with Gleam.

However I've not answer the question of why make a new language at all- we
already have several fantastic languages on the BEAM such as Erlang, Elixir,
and LFE. Why spend all this time creating Gleam when we could use one of
these?

To answer this question I'd like to take a closer look at the BEAM's self
healing properties and how that impacts us as developers and operators of
software.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-1.png">
???

It's a normal day at work and I've got a change to make to an application.
Perhaps I'm adding a feature, maybe we're removing a bug, it doesn't matter,
I'm making some sort of change.

I spend some time editing the code, making my changes.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-2.png">
???

Once satisfied run the compiler to build the application, which completes
successfully, reporting no problems.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-3.png">
???

After that I run the unit tests on my laptop to ensure I've not broken
anything, and then push my changes to GitHub.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-4.png">
???

Once uploaded the code triggers a build on the CI server. It runs all the unit
and integration tests, and runs some linters such as Credo to spot any mistakes.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-5.png">
???

If all those checks pass then it deploys the new application version to a
staging environment.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-6.png">
???

On the staging environment I manually test the application and demo the new
behaviour to stakeholders who give the green light to continue.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-7.png">
???

Meanwhile, on GitHub the code is reviewed by some of the other programmers on
my team, as they may have some context or insights that I do not.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-8.png">
???

Happy with my changes they approve it and the code is merged into
master, triggering another CI build.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-9.png">
???


All the tests are run again to ensure no problems were introduced during the
merge.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle.png">
???

And lastly, once the tests have passed again the code is deployed to
production, and released to our users. Satisfied with a job well done, I go for
lunch.

But then! Disaster strikes! Users are reporting that the application no longer
works as intended. Right at the very beginning when I was editing the code I
made a mistake and introduced a bug.

Each one of these steps has failed to detect the problem and now the bug has
snuck into production. Luckily the application is written in Erlang so the
impact of the problem has been minimised, but I still need to fix the problem
as a matter of urgency.

---
class: center middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/time.png">
???

In this instance the problem was discovered just a few hours after I made the
mistake, so the change is still fresh in my mind and it's not too difficult to
correct it, but that's not always the case.

Depending on the culture of the company I'm working at it might take days or
weeks for a change to be deployed to production, or it might have taken longer
for the users to discover the problem.

Worse case scenario it has been months or years and the writer of the bug has
long since left the company, leaving me to try and fix code I've never seen
before.

---
class: center middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/science.png">
???

The larger the gap between the mistake being made and the problem being
detected the more difficult it will be to fix.

Of course this isn't the only factor in the difficulty, but it is an important
multiplier.

Erlang gives us powerful tools to tolerate mistakes and debug them, but they
largely only help us once the code is in production, and that time cost and
loss of familiarity is far from optimal.

---
class: minimal-padding middle center
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/bug-detected.png">
???

What I really want is to for problems to be detected here, immediately after the
mistake was made.

I want that feedback loop to be as fast as possible so we can spend less time
doing exploratory work (such as debugging) and more time iterating (actually
providing business value).

---
class: minimal-padding center middle
<img class="color-adjust" style="padding-bottom: 40px" src="img/ml-family.png">
???

Gleam aims to provide that fast and safe feedback loop by introducing a type
inspired by those found in the ML family of languages.

Why these languages? Because I believe they are currently the languages that
do best at providing this rapid feedback loop.

Let's look at some examples:

---
## Reason

<img class="center-element" style="max-width: 60%" src="img/messenger.png">

> Messenger used to receive bugs reports on a daily basis; since the
> introduction of Reason, there have been a total of 10 bugs (that's during

<cite>

</cite>

???

Messenger is Facebook's web chat program. It has 1.3 billion monthly users.

Back in 2016 they started converting the web client from Javascript to a
dialect of OCaml called Reason. A year later 50% of their code was written in
Reason and they had this to say:

**QUOTE**

Quite an impressive statement!


---
## Elm

> production runtime exception.

NoRedInk are a company in the United States that provide education software.

Back in 2016 they started adding Elm code to their Coffeescript web
application with great success. In 2018 one of their engineers, Richard
Feldman, posted this tweet:

**QUOTE**

This is not to say the engineers at NoRedInk and Facebook are without error,
they make as many mistakes as you or I.

The key takeaway here is that they are discovering and fixing their mistakes
before they get to production, or at least the ones that cause runtime errors.


---
## Purescript

Lumi is a company that provide custom eco-friendly branded packaging for

What I like about this is the feeling of trust in the compiler, that it is
something that can be relied on.

like a pair programming partner, there to help by catching mistakes and
providing additional insight.


---

<img class="center-element" style="" src="img/demo.png">

???

And now for the scary bit!

In order to give a brief introduction to Gleam as a language I'm going to
write a very simple web application on top of an Erlang web server, using
Gleam's Erlang FFI.

# What's next for Gleam?

???

Gleam's a new language and there's many things still to come, so what's coming
up next?

---
class: xl-code
## Function arguments

```rust
version.matches(
  "3.0.3",
  "3.0",
  False,
)
```
???

With functions that take multiple argument it can be difficult to remember
what the arguments are and in which order they go.

This is especially true when a function has not very descriptive types, such
as this one that takes String, String, Bool


---
class: xl-code
## Labelled function arguments

```rust
version.matches(
  version: "3.0.3",
  requirement: "3.0",
  allow_pre: False,
)
```
???

The next version of Gleam will have labelled arguments, a popular feature from
languages such as Python and OCaml.

With this feature arguments can optionally have names at the call site, making
it clearer what they are and allowing them to be given in any order.

Sometimes in Erlang and Elixir we will give arguments in a map or a keyword
list to name arguments, but there is a small performance penalt to this.

Gleam's labelled arguments will be resolved entirely at compile time and have
no performance cost.


---
class: l-code center
## Exhaustiveness checking

```rust
enum Pet =
| Cat
| Dog
```

```rust
fn to_string(pet) {
  case pet {
  | Cat -> "kitty"
  | Dog -> "doggo"
  }
}
```

???

This feature is a personal favourite of mine and something that I'm really
looking forward to.

Let's say I've defined a Pet type in my codebase. It's an enum with 2
variants: Cat and Dog.

Elsewhere in my code I define a to_string function which pattern matches on a
pet and returns an appropriate string for each.

---
class: l-code center
## Exhaustiveness checking

```rust
enum Pet =
| Cat
| Dog
| Tamagotchi
```

```rust
fn to_string(pet) {
  case pet {
  | Cat -> "kitty"
  | Dog -> "doggo"
  }
}
```

???

Shortly afterward a new craze takes the nation by storm, an electronic pet
called a Tamagotchi. Not wanting to be left behind I add a Tamagotchi variant
to the Pet enum and ship my code to production.

Sadly I've forgotten to update the `to_string` function, so later when the
function is called with the Tamagotchi variant no clause matches causing the
process running the code to crash.

It's easy to see on this slide that the `to_string` function needs to be
updated, but in a codebase of tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code
it's hard to find all the places that need to be updated when a new variant is
added.

Once Gleam has exhaustiveness checking this kind of mistake will be
detected at compile time.

The compiler will halt and show the location of the problem and show what
patterns are missing, making this kind of error impossible.


---
## Editor integration

<img class="center-element" style="" src="img/editors.png">

???

Productivity is a core value for Gleam, and having good development tooling is
important for productivity.

We want the experience of writing Gleam code to be as slick and enjoyable as
possible, no matter what the editor the programmer is using. To achieve this
Gleam will implement Microsoft's Language Server Protocol.

Once implemented users of vim, emacs, atom, vs code and more will be able to
do the following:

- Display type errors in editor after every keystroke
- Provide code completion options for variables, modules, functions
- Show documentation and type information in the editor
- jump to the definition of functions and types
- Perform language aware renaming of variables, functions, and more with a
  single command
- format code automatically when saving a file, like with exfmt

And what's more thanks to Gleam's type system and static analysis this tooling
will be able to provide much richer information to the programmer than is
possible with other BEAM languages.

---
## Documentation
<img class="center-element" alt="documentation" style="" src="img/documentation.png">

???

Another part of the developer experience puzzle is documentation.

I don't know if anyone here has written a program in Gleam but right now it's
not as easy as it ought to be.

Unless you want to read the source code of any libraries you're using there's
no way to learn what modules and functions are available.

---
class: splash-image
<img src="img/hexdocs.png">
???

Meanwhile Elixir has the beautiful, searchable, mobile friendly documentation
generated from the code itself by the ex_doc tool, hosted on the hexdocs
website and linked directly to the hex package itself.

In Elixir it's easy to find the documentation you need, whether it's online,
in your editor, or on the command line, and we intend for this to be the case
for Gleam too.

Exactly what the best approach to take here is unclear, though we are
currently looking at whether we could use Elixir's ex_doc for Gleam.

## Exercism
<img class="center-element" style="max-width: 70%" src="img/exercism.png">

https://exercism.io

???

Who's familiar with Exercism?

Exercism is a fantastic place for people to learn new programming languages
and to practice their coding skills.

---
class: middle

<img class="center-element" src="img/exercism-learn.png">
???

How does it work? A programmer picks a language they want to practice and
Exercism gives them an exercise to complete.

Each exercise has instructions, some skeleton code to fill in, and a full set
of unit tests to make pass.


---
class: middle

<img class="center-element" style="padding-top: 69px" src="img/exercism-chat.png">


???

Once the programmer has completed their solution they can to submit it back to
Exercism, where they get getting friendly and constructive feedback from track
mentors and other students.

They can also view solutions from other people and learn different approaches
to the same problem.


---
class: center

## 51 Languages and counting

<img class="center-element" src="img/exercism-languages.png">

???

Exercism currently has 51 live languages tracks and has given the thumbs up
for a Gleam track.

The exercises need to be ported to Gleam and documentation needs to be
written, but once done we'll have a top notch experience for learning and
practicing Gleam.

Exercism is community run, open source, and very well organised so if you're
interested in contributing to Gleam this could be a great place to create
help out.


---
## Typed OTP

```rust
pub struct Spec(arg, state, call, reply, cast) {
  init:
    fn(arg) -> Init(state)

  handle_call:
    fn(call, state) -> Call(reply, state)

  handle_cast:
    fn(cast, state) -> Cast(state)

  handle_info:
    fn(Any, state) -> Cast(state)
}

pub external fn start_link(Spec(a, b, c, d, e))
  -> Result(GenServer(b, c, d, e), InitError)
  = "gleam_gen_server" "start_link"
```
???

One question that is frequently asked is how does Gleam type processes and
OTP. The short answer is that it doesn't.

Gleam doesn't currently have any special first class support for processes or
OTP, instead these Erlang features are to be used via the Erlang FFI.

Today we have some simple bindings to `gen_server` that allow us to define and
use them in a type safe way, but we lack type safe bindings to other
behaviours such as supervisor.

The challenge here is how to write bindings that are reasonably safe but
flexible enough to support common Erlang patterns used today.

In future we could add some new features to Gleam that make it possible to
create better support for processes, but if we do I want these language
extensions to be generically useful rather than specific to processes.

Any new language extensions should be applicable to a wide variety of problems
and make the language more powerful as a whole.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
# On the horizon

???

And on that note I'd like to share with you an idea for a future addition to
Gleam.

This is still very much in the early design stage so it may change quite a bit
before we come to add this to the language.


---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```elixir
defprotocol String.Chars do
  @spec to_string(t) :: String.t()
  def to_string(term)
end

defimpl String.Chars, for: Integer do
  def to_string(term) do
    Integer.to_string(term)
  end
end

defimpl String.Chars, for: Float do
  def to_string(term) do
    term |> :io_lib_format.fwrite_g() |> IO.iodata_to_binary()
  end
end
```
???

Today all functions in Gleam are monomorphic, it's not possible to write a
function that takes a list OR a map.

Another problem is that we can't take a function (behaviour) from a library
and make it work with types that we have defined. If someone writes a function
that takes a list we can't give it a new vector type that we have implemented,
even if conceptually a vector would work OK for what the function does.

Elixir solves this with protocols.

For example, Elixir's String.Char protocol allows the `to_string` function to
work on Lists, Atoms, Ints, Floats and more.

If we want the `to_string` function to work on new types that we have created
we can implement the protocol for that type.

---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```rust
pub trait ToString {
  fn to_string(Self) -> String
}

let Int: ToString {
  fn to_string(term) {
    int.to_string(term)
  }
}


let Float: ToString {
  fn to_string(term) {
    term |> fwrite_g |> iodata.to_string
  }
}
```
???

Here's what the same protocol may look like in Gleam, though right now we're
calling them traits.

It's similar in that there's a definition for the `ToString` trait and two
implementations, and now the `to_string` function can be used on either `Ints`
or `Floats`.

What's different is how the language dispatches to the correct implementation
for a given type.

Elixir inspects the value at runtime, which is why Elixir's protocols can only
be defined for structs and a few special types. It is not possible to
implement a protocol for types that have the same runtime representation.

For example, it is not possible to have an implementation for an Erlang record
and another for a queue, as both are tuples at runtime.

Gleam's traits instead will dispatch using type information, so a trait can be
implemented for two types even if they have the same runtime representation.


---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```rust
pub trait Default {
  fn default() -> Self
}

let Int: Default {
  fn default(s) {
    0
  }
}


let Float: Default {
  fn default(s) {
    0.0
  }
}
```
???

Another cool thing about dispatching using type information is that Gleam can
dispatch based upon a return type rather than just the argument, as is the
case in this `default` function.

This wouldn't be possible to implement in Elixir's protocols as we need a
value to find the implementation to use, but the only way to obtain a value is
to invoke the correct implementation.

We have a chicken and egg problem.

This is however possible if we dispatch using type information

This type based polymorphism has much more expressive power and I think we
could find many exciting uses for a system like this.
