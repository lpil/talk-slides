## Hi, I'm Louis!

???

I'm Louis, I've been a heavy user of Elixir and Erlang for about 5 years now.

I'm the founder of a small ad-tech company called Waive that uses Elixir for
everything, with a little Elm sprinkled on top.

In addition I'm a platform engineer at Nationwide Building Society, where
mostly I work with Go and Kubernetes.

I also do some open source work in the Erlang world:

I wrote Dogma, a style linter for Elixir, later succeeded by Credo, which
we're going to hear about later from Rene.

After that I wrote mix test.watch, an automated test runner for Elixir, and
exfmt, an Elixir auto-formatter that was succeeded by the official formatter
released in Elixir v1.6.

I've also done some work inside the Elixir compiler. For example I taught the
inspect protocol about colours, and I used this to add syntax highlighting to
the iex.

But today I'm not here to talk about any of those things, I'm here to talk
about Gleam!

What is Gleam?


---
## Hello, Gleam!
## TODO: Some graphic

???

Gleam is a new functional programming language for the BEAM. Like Elixir it
compiles to Erlang and adds no runtime overhead so we should always be at
least as performant as typical Elixir and Erlang code.

Gleam is intended to integrate well into the larger BEAM ecosystem, so it's
straightforward and zero cost to call Erlang and Elixir from Gleam, or to call
Gleam from Erlang and Elixir. We want to enrichen and contribute to the BEAM
ecosystem through collaboration, not fracture it.

Possibly the most distinct and interesting of Gleam's features is it's type
system. Gleam has a strong static type system inspired by ML family languages
such as Elm, Haskell, and Rust. I think this type system is where most the
value of Gleam can be found.


---
## Why Gleam?
???

Here's the first question I want to answer- Why make this new language at all
when there are already so many other languages out there?

---
## The BEAM

A large part of the answer to that question is the BEAM, the Erlang virtual
machine.

The Erlang virtual machine is a fantastic piece of software and one of the
best language runtimes available today.

It has powerful concurrency features in the form of actor model, allowing us
to spin up hundreds of thousands of lightweight threads called processes
inside our programs, making full use of modern computer processors, which
these days have more and more cores.

These processes communicate by sending messages to each other, but what's
amazing about this is that it doesn't matter if the processes are running on
the same instance of the BEAM, a second instance of the BEAM on the same
computer, or even on a completely different machine on the network.

Distributed computing is built into the BEAM, a typical BEAM program written
in Erlang or Elixir can be turned into distributed program that runs on a
cluster of networked computers with minimal effort.

Like most runtimes the BEAM offers garbage collection, however what makes it
unusual is that it is performed on a per-process basis.

This mean there is no stop-the-world pause for memory to be cleaned up,
meaning programs on the BEAM can have predictable low latency and are often
referred to as being soft real time.

---
# TODO

???

And perhaps most excitingly, Erlang processes act as error bulkheads, meaning
that when something does go wrong and your code crashes the problem is
contained to the smallest possible sub-system and will not impact any other
work being undertaken by the program.

An Erlang program that takes advantage of this property can self heal by
restarting the process and trying again, hopefully succeeding now that any
corrupt state has been shed, must like pods on the popular Kubernetes
container orchestrator from Google.

What makes the BEAM different from Kubernetes is that this state shedding can
happen at a much more fine grained level- we won't lose the state of the
entire program and all the requests being handled by it, instead just the
single process that had the problem.

---
# TODO

So yes, the BEAM is wonderful piece of technology to work with, and I'm sure
that you'll all understand why I wanted to use target it.

However I've not answer the question of why make a new language at all- we
already have several fantastic languages on the BEAM such as Erlang, Elixir,
and LFE. Why spend all this time creating Gleam when we could use one of
these?

To answer this question I'd like to take a closer look at the BEAM's self
healing properties and how that impacts us as developers and operators of
software.

---
# TODO

???

It's a normal day at work and I've got a change to make to an application.
Perhaps I'm adding a feature, maybe we're removing a bug, it doesn't matter,
I'm making some sort of change.

I spend some time editing the code, and once satisfied run the compiler to
build the application, which completes successfully.

After that I run the unit tests on my laptop to ensure I've not broken
anything, and then push my changes to GitHub.

Once uploaded the code triggers a build on the CI server. It runs all the unit
and integration tests, and runs some linters such as Credo to spot any mistakes.

If all those checks pass then it deploys the new application version to a
staging environment.

On the staging environment I manually test the application and demo the new
behaviour to stakeholders who give the green light to continue.

Meanwhile, on GitHub the code is reviewed by some of the other programmers on
my team. Happy with my changes they approve it and the code is merged into
master, triggering another CI build. All the tests are run again, and this
time the code is deployed to production and to our users.

But then! Disaster strikes! Users are reporting that the application no longer
works as intended. Right at the very beginning when I was editing the code I
made a mistake and introduced a bug.

Each one of these steps has failed to detect the problem and now it has snuck
into production. Luckily the application is written in Erlang so the impact of
the problem has been minimised, but I still need to fix the problem as a
matter of urgency.

In this instance the problem was discovered just a few hours after I made the
mistake, so the change is still fresh in my mind and it's not too difficult to
correct it, but that's not always the case.

Depending on the culture of the company I'm working at it might take days or
weeks for a change to be deployed to production, or it might have taken longer
for the users to discover the problem.

Worse case scenario it has been months or years and the writer of the bug has
long since left the company, leaving me to try and fix code I've never seen
before.

---
# TODO
???

The larger the gap between the mistake being made and the problem being
detected the more difficult it will be to fix.

Erlang gives us powerful tools to tolerate mistakes and debug them, but they
largely only help us once the code is in production, and that time cost is far
from optimal.

What I really want is to for problems to be detected here, immediately after the
mistake was made.

I want that feedback loop to be as fast as possible so we can spend less time
doing exploratory work (such as debugging) and more time iterating (actually
providing business value).

---
# TODO
???

Gleam aims to provide that fast and safe feedback loop by introducing a type
inspired by those found in the ML family of languages.

Why these languages? Because I believe they are the languages that currently
do best in this regard.

Let's look at some examples:

---
## Reason @ Facebook Messenger

???

Messenger is Facebook's web chat program. It has 1.3 billion monthly users.

Back in 2016 they started converting the web client from Javascript to a
dialect of OCaml called Reason. A year later 50% of their code was written in
Reason and they had this to say:


---
## Elm @ NoRedInk

NoRedInk are a company in the United States that provide education software.

Back in 2016 they started adding Elm code to their Coffeescript web
application with great success. In 2018 one of their engineers posted this
tweet:

**QUOTE**

This is not to say the engineers at NoRedInk are without error, they make as
many mistakes as you or I. They are catching their mistakes before they get to
production, or at least the ones that cause runtime errors.

# What's next for Gleam?

???

Gleam's a new language and there's many things still to come, so what's coming
up next?

---
class: xl-code
## Function arguments

```rust
version.matches(
  "3.0.3",
  "3.0",
  False,
)
```
???

With functions that take multiple argument it can be difficult to difficult to
remember what the arguments are and which order they are expected in

This is especially true when reading unfamiliar code.


---
class: xl-code
## Labelled function arguments

```rust
version.matches(
  version: "3.0.3",
  requirement: "3.0",
  allow_pre: False,
)
```
???

Future versions of Gleam will have labelled arguments, a popular feature from
languages such as Python and OCaml.

With this feature arguments can optionally have names at the call site, making
it clearer what they are and allowing them to be given in any order.

Sometimes in Erlang and Elixir we will give arguments in a map or a keyword
list to name arguments, but there is a small performance penalt to this.

Gleam's labelled arguments will be resolved entirely at compile time and have
no performance cost.


---
class: center
## Windows support

<img class="center-element" style="max-width: 80%; padding-right: 7%" src="img/windows.png">

???

Linux and MacOS are popular with developers, but Windows is still the most
widely used desktop operating system in the world.

We want the barrier to entry to be as low as possible for users of all
operating systems, so having excellent Windows support is key.

This is especially important as many people who are new to programming will be
using Windows computers, and we want to make their learning journey as
frustration free as possible.


---
class: l-code center
## Exhaustiveness checking

```rust
enum Pet =
| Cat
| Dog
```

```rust
fn to_string(pet) {
  case pet {
  | Cat -> "kitty"
  | Dog -> "doggo"
  }
}
```

???

This feature is a personal favourite of mine and something that I'm really
looking forward to.

Let's say I've defined a Pet type in my codebase. It's an enum with 2
variants: Cat and Dog.

Elsewhere in my code I define a to_string function which pattern matches on a
pet and returns the string "kitty" for cats, and "doggo" for dogs.

---
class: l-code center
## Exhaustiveness checking

```rust
enum Pet =
| Cat
| Dog
| Tamagotchi
```

```rust
fn to_string(pet) {
  case pet {
  | Cat -> "kitty"
  | Dog -> "doggo"
  }
}
```

???

Shortly afterward a new craze takes the nation by storm, an electronic pet
called a Tamagotchi. Not wanting to be left behind I add a Tamagotchi variant
to the Pet enum and ship my code to production.

Sadly I've forgotten to update the `to_string` function, so later when the
function is called with the Tamagotchi variant no clause matches and the
process crashes, causing degraded functionality in my web application.

It's easy to see on this slide that the `to_string` function needs to be
updated, but in a codebase of tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code
it's hard to find all the places that need to be updated when a new variant is
added.

Once Gleam has exhaustiveness checking this will kind of mistake will be
detected at compile time. It'll show the location of the incomplete pattern
match and show what values will cause the pattern match to crash, making this
kind of error impossible.


---
## Editor integration

<img class="center-element" style="" src="img/editors.png">

???

Productivity is a core value for Gleam, and the experience of the developer as
they read and write Gleam code is a big piece of this.

We want the experience of writing Gleam code to be as slick and enjoyable as
possible. We want IDE like features for Gleam in all the major editors, and by
implementing Language Server Protocol in the compiler we can get that.

Language Server Protocol is a standard developed by Microsoft for
communication between text editors and IDE engines. Once the Gleam compiler
implements it users of vim, emacs, atom, vs code and more will be able to:

Display type errors in editor after every keystroke.

Provide code completion options for variables, modules, functions, and so on.

Show documentation and type information on hover, as well as
jump-to-definition.

Perform language aware renaming of variables, functions, and more with a
single command

And every time the user saves we can automatically format the code, like with
Elixir's mix format command.

And what's more thanks to Gleam's type system and static analysis this tooling
will be able to provide much richer information to the programmer than is
possible with other BEAM languages.

---
## Documentation
<img class="center-element" alt="documentation" style="" src="img/documentation.png">

???

Another (perhaps more important) part of the developer experience puzzle is
documentation.

I don't know if anyone here has written a program in Gleam but right now it's
not as easy as it could be.

Unless you want to read the source code of the standard library or other
libraries there's no way to learn what modules and functions are available.

---
class: splash-image
<img src="img/hexdocs.png">

Meanwhile Elixir has the beautiful, searchable, mobile friendly documentation
generated from the code itself by the ex_doc tool, hosted on the hexdocs
website and linked directly to the hex package itself.

In Elixir it's easy to find the documentation you need, whether it's online,
in your editor, or on the command line, and we intend for this to be the case
for Gleam too.

Exactly what the best approach to take here is unclear, though we are
currently looking at whether we could use Elixir's ex_doc for Gleam.

This could be a great place someone to contribute a lot of value to Gleam,
especially someone comfortable working in Elixir.

## Exercism

Who's familiar with Exercism?

TODO: Replace the Ruby logo with Gleam's in this graphic

Exercism is a fantastic place to learn new programming languages and to
practice their coding skills.

How does it work? The programmer decides what language they want to practice
and Exercism gives them an exercise to complete.

Each exercises has instructions, and a full set of unit tests to make pass.


---
class: middle

<img class="center-element" style="padding-top: 69px" src="img/exercism-chat.png">


???

Once the programmer has completed their solution they can to submit it back to
Exercism, getting friendly and constructive feedback on their solution by
track mentors and other students.

They can also view solutions from other people and learn different approaches
to the same problem.


---
class: center

## 51 Languages and counting

<img class="center-element" src="img/exercism-languages.png">

???

Exercism has 51 languages tracks and has given the thumbs up for a Gleam
track.

Exercisms exercises need to be implemented for Gleam and documentation needs
to be written, but once done we'll have a top notch experience for learning
and practicing Gleam.

Exercism is community run, open source, and very well organised so if you're
interested in contributing to Gleam this could be a great place to create
help out.


---
class: center

## Future research

TODO: microscope graphic or something?

???

This next feature is still in the early ideas stage so don't get too attached.

If and when when this makes it into the language it may be completely
different.


---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```elixir
defprotocol String.Chars do
  @spec to_string(t) :: String.t()
  def to_string(term)
end

defimpl String.Chars, for: Integer do
  def to_string(term) do
    Integer.to_string(term)
  end
end

defimpl String.Chars, for: Float do
  def to_string(term) do
    term |> :io_lib_format.fwrite_g() |> IO.iodata_to_binary()
  end
end
```
???

Today all functions in Gleam are monomorphic, it's not possible to write a
function that takes a list OR a map.

Another problem is that we can't take a function (behaviour) from a library
and make it work with types that we have defined. If someone writes a function
that takes a list we can't give it a new vector type that we have implemented,
even if conceptually a vector would work OK for what the function does.

Elixir solves this with protocols.

For example, Elixir's String.Char protocol allows the `to_string` function to
work on Lists, Atoms, Ints, Floats and more.

If we want the `to_string` function to work on new types that we have created
we can implement the protocol for that type.

---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```rust
pub trait ToString {
  fn to_string(Self) -> String
}

let Int: ToString {
  fn to_string(term) {
    int.to_string(term)
  }
}


let Float: ToString {
  fn to_string(term) {
    term |> fwrite_g |> iodata.to_string
  }
}
```
???

Goals
- statically resolved at compile time
- works on all types, not just structs as in Elixir


---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```rust
pub trait FromString {
  fn from_string(String) -> Result(Self, String)
}

let Int: FromString {
  fn from_string(s) {
    int.parse(s)
  }
}


let Float: FromString {
  fn from_string(s) {
    float.parse(s)
  }
}
```
???
can dispatch based on the return type

---
## Typed OTP

```rust
pub struct Spec(arg, state, call, reply, cast) {
  init:
    fn(arg) -> Init(state)

  handle_call:
    fn(call, state) -> Call(reply, state)

  handle_cast:
    fn(cast, state) -> Cast(state)

  handle_info:
    fn(Any, state) -> Cast(state)
}
```
???

One question that is frequently asked is how does Gleam type processes and
OTP. The short answer is that it doesn't.

Gleam doesn't currently have any special first class support for processes or
OTP, instead these Erlang features are to be used via the Erlang FFI.

Today we have some simple bindings to `gen_server` that allow us to define and
use them in a type safe way, but we lack type safe bindings to other
behaviours such as supervisor.

Seeing as these bindings are written entirely in Gleam with no compiler magic
this could be a fun project for someone to experiment with. The challenge here
is how to write bindings that are reasonably safe but flexible enough to
support common Erlang patterns used today.

In future we could add some new features to Gleam that make better support for
OTP possible, but I want these language extensions to be generically useful
rather than specific to OTP. Any new features should be applicable to a wide
variety of problems and make the language more powerful as a whole.
