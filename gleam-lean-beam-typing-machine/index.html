TODO: Replace the Ruby logo with Gleam's in this graphic

Exercism is a fantastic place to learn new programming languages and to
practice their coding skills.

How does it work? The programmer decides what language they want to practice
and Exercism gives them an exercise to complete.

Each exercises has instructions, and a full set of unit tests to make pass.

Once the programmer has completed their solution they can to submit it back to
Exercism, getting friendly and constructive feedback on their solution by
track mentors and other students.

They can also view solutions from other people and learn different approaches
to the same problem.

## 51 Languages and counting

<img class="center-element" src="img/exercism-languages.png">

???

Exercism has 51 languages tracks and has given the thumbs up for a Gleam
track.

Exercisms exercises need to be implemented for Gleam and documentation needs
to be written, but once done we'll have a top notch experience for learning
and practicing Gleam.

Exercism is community run, open source, and very well organised so if you're
interested in contributing to Gleam this could be a great place to create
help out.
