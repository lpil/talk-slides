# Gleam: Lean BEAM typing machine

With their impressive concurrency features and robust approach to handling
failure it is a joy to build scalable and reliable systems with BEAM languages
such as Erlang and Elixir! However, all is not perfect: as codebases get
larger and less familiar it becomes more difficult to make changes, with
mistakes creating bugs that test out runtime resilience and make pagers ring
in the middle of the night.

In this talk Louis introduces Gleam, a new language that takes inspiration
from strongly typed languages such as Haskell, Rust and Elm to help BEAM
programmers tackle these problems. We'll take a look at what Gleam offers, how
it's made, and how it complements and interoperates other BEAM languages.
Lastly we'll take a peek at what's planned for Gleam, and how people can get
involved.
