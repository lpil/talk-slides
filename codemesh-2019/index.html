## Hi, I'm Louis!

https://lpil.uk/talk-slides/codemesh-2019

???

Hello everyone! I'm Louis! Welcome to my CodeMesh talk!

There's two other excellent talks happening right now so thank you very much
for taking a chance with me.

Hopefully everyone can see the slides OK, but just in case these slides can be
found at this URL.

I usually talk at Erlang events so I wasn't sure what kind of audience I'd
attract today. If at any point what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you
please wave your hand and I'll try again.

Let's get started!

class: slide-dark middle center
<img style="width: 75%; padding-right: 45px" src="img/gleam-pink.svg">

???

I'm here today to talk about Gleam, which is a new statically typed
programming language for the Erlang virtual machine that I've been working on
for the last 2 years or so.

Gleam draws inspiration from both BEAM languages such as Elixir and Erlang,
and ML languages such as Haskell and Elm.

In this talk I'm going to take a look at these two sets of language and see
why I think they're each special in their own way.

After that we can take a look at this new language Gleam, and see how it
attempts to bring together some of the best traits of both ML languages and
BEAM languages.

# Why Erlang?
???

One of Gleam's greatest strengths is that it compiles to Erlang and as such
can take advantage of all the wonderful things that Erlang has to offer.

So, what's so special about Erlang?


---
class: middle
<img class="color-adjust center-element" src="img/the-beam.png">
???

A large part of the answer to that question is the BEAM, the Erlang virtual
machine.

Erlang is slightly unusual for a functional programming language in that it
originated largely from industry rather than academia. Back in the 80s the
telephony company Ericsson were looking for the ideal language for writing
telephone switch firmware in, and from this Erlang was born.

In order to meet the unusual requirements of the telephony environment Erlang
and the BEAM developed some rather exciting features.


---
class: middle
TODO cute telephone graphic
???

For a telephone switch to be useful it needs to be able to support multiple
phone calls at the same time. If you had to wait for your neighbour to get off
the phone before you could make a call I suspect telephones probably wouldn't
have caught on.

Because of this Erlang had to have great concurrency features, any program
written in it needed to be able to trivially perform a great number of tasks
at the same time.

This was such an important feature they ended up naming the language after it.
An Erlang is a unit of concurrency, it measures seconds per second.

A telephone switch that can hold 100 simultaneous calls can support a load of
100 Erlangs.


---
class: middle
TODO ejabberd
???

So how does the BEAM scale when it comes to concurrency? We can look at some
benchmarks of real-world systems.

ejabberd is a websocket based chat server, a fork of which powers WhatsApp,
the popular chat app from Facebook. In their benchmarks the ejabberd team
recorded 2 million active connections to a single server, which is quite a
feat.

https://blog.process-one.net/ejabberd-massive-scalability-1node-2-million-concurrent-users/


---
class: middle
TODO phoenix
???

Phoenix Channels is a websocket based pubsub system with present features. In
their benchmarks they also scaled to 2 million active connections on a single
machine, and they found they could publish events to all of them in under a
second.

A common feature of both these benchmarks is that the limiting factor was
reported as being not the BEAM itself, but the underlying network hardware and
the Linux networking stack making it difficult to open and use 2 million TCP
sockets.

https://phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections


---
class: middle
TODO ericsson
???

Lastly, in a more contrived benchmark the Erlang team at Ericsson tested to
see how many threads they could create in a single program. On a computer with
16GB of RAM they found they could create 20 million threads without problem.

On average it took 5 nano-seconds to create a thread, and 6 nano-seconds for
any of these threads to respond to a message sent to it.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.lang.functional/5kldn1QJ73c/T3py-yqmtzMJ


---
class: middle
TODO same cute telephone graphic again
???

The BEAM can scale in this way, but it's not good enough to mearly be
possible, it has to be relatively easy for the programmer.

Asynchronous programming is notoriously difficult, especially if you're
working with tools like locks, callbacks, and shared mutable state, so the
creators of Erlang went down a different route.


---
class: middle
TODO cute telephone graphic with multiple processes
???

Rather than having a small number of threads each handling a large number of
concurrent tasks, in the Erlang world we use a great number of threads, but
each thread only has 1 task to perform.

In this way each thread, which in the Erlang world we call a Process, can be
written entirely synchronously, dramatically simplifying the problem.

If each process only has to do one thing it can be written in a sequential
fashion. The programmer doesn't have to write any asynchronous code within the
single process.

To paraphrase the late Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang, it's easier to have 2
million web servers handling 2 million sessions than it is to have 1 web
server handling 2 million sessions.


---
class: middle
TODO Erlang processes and OS threads
???

To support concurrency this high Erlang processes are not implemented as
operating systems threads, instead they are lightweight green threads
with their own scheduler within the BEAM.

Back in the late 80s computer processors only had a single core, so while
Erlang programs were highly concurrent they were still single threaded.

When processors with multiple cores started to appear the BEAM was upgraded to
schedule Erlang processes across all available cores, making full use of all
processing power available.

Overnight all Erlang program became multi-core programs, and now writing a
multi-core program in Erlang is no more difficult than any other program.


---
## Messages
<br>
<img class="color-adjust center-element" style="max-width: 90%" src="img/messages.png">
???

Sadly the processes in these telephony switches couldn't be completely
isolated from each other, there's always going to need to be some
communication between threads in any program.

Rather than using shared state communicate each Erlang processes by sending
messages to each other asynchronously.

What's more interesting is that processes within a telephone switch don't need
to just talk to processes within the same switch, they also need to
communicate with many other devices in the network as calls are routed through
various bits hardware to get to their destination.

Because of this need it is that it doesn't matter if the processes are
running on the same instance of the BEAM, different instances of the BEAM on
the same computer, or even two completely different computers connected by a
network: The processes can still send messages to each other.

Distributed computing is built into the BEAM, a typical BEAM program written
in Erlang or Elixir can be turned into distributed program that runs on a
cluster of networked computers with minimal effort.


---
## Garbage collection
<img class="color-adjust center-element" src="img/garbage-collection.png">
???

Ericsson didn't want their programmers to have to deal with the error prone
business of manual memory management, so the BEAM implements garbage
collection.

This however posed a problem. Many runtimes will pause all computation in
order to perform garbage collection, but here that's not an option. The switch
can't let all calls hang for a second while it sorts out the memory, it needs
to continue to operate continuously without interruption.

So instead of performing garbage collection on the entire program the BEAM
performs it on a per process basis. Rather than stopping everything only
individual processes that are due a clean-up will be paused, giving Erlang
programs predictable low-latency.


---
## Fault tolerance
<img class="color-adjust center-element" src="img/isolation.png">
???

And perhaps most excitingly, Erlang processes act as error bulkheads, meaning
that when something does go wrong and your code crashes the problem is
contained to the smallest possible sub-system and will not impact any other
work being undertaken by the program.

An Erlang program that takes advantage of this property can self heal by
restarting the process and trying again, hopefully succeeding now that any
corrupt state has been shed.

In this way the BEAM is much like Kubernetes, the popular container
orchestrator from Google.

What makes the BEAM different from Kubernetes is that this state shedding can
happen at a much more fine grained level- we won't lose the state of the
entire program and all the requests being handled by it, instead just the
single process that had the problem.

---
TODO telephone to internet graphic
???

The BEAM was created with the problem of telephony in mind, but it turns out
that what was once quite a niche set of problems is actually quite commonplace
today.

Concurrency, parallelism, distribution, low latency, and fault tolerance:
these are characteristics we want in networked services today.

The BEAM has almost by chance has become an excellent platform for building
web applications, databases, message brokers, or many of these other things
that web developers deal with on a daily basis.


---
## Why a new language?
<br>
<img class="center-element" src="img/beam-languages.png">
???

So now hopefully we

So yes, the BEAM is wonderful piece of technology to work with, and I'm sure
that you'll all understand why I wanted to use it with Gleam.

However I've not answer the question of why make a new language at all- we
already have several fantastic languages on the BEAM such as Erlang, Elixir,
and LFE. Why spend all this time creating Gleam when we could use one of
these?

To answer this question I'd like to take a closer look at the BEAM's self
healing properties and how that impacts us as developers and operators of
software.

---

It's a normal day at work and I've got a change to make to an application.
Perhaps I'm adding a feature, maybe we're removing a bug, it doesn't matter,
I'm making some sort of change.

I spend some time editing the code, making my changes.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-2.png">
???

Once satisfied run the compiler to build the application, which completes
successfully, reporting no problems.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-3.png">
???

After that I run the unit tests on my laptop to ensure I've not broken
anything, and then push my changes to GitHub.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-4.png">
???

Once uploaded the code triggers a build on the CI server. It runs all the unit
and integration tests, and runs some linters such as Credo to spot any mistakes.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-5.png">
???

If all those checks pass then it deploys the new application version to a
staging environment.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-6.png">
???

On the staging environment I manually test the application and demo the new
behaviour to stakeholders who give the green light to continue.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-7.png">
???

Meanwhile, on GitHub the code is reviewed by some of the other programmers on
my team, as they may have some context or insights that I do not.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-8.png">
???

Happy with my changes they approve it and the code is merged into
master, triggering another CI build.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle-9.png">
???


All the tests are run again to ensure no problems were introduced during the
merge.

---
class: minimal-padding middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/cycle.png">
???

And lastly, once the tests have passed again the code is deployed to
production, and released to our users. Satisfied with a job well done, I go for
lunch.

But then! Disaster strikes! Users are reporting that the application no longer
works as intended. Right at the very beginning when I was editing the code I
made a mistake and introduced a bug.

Each one of these steps has failed to detect the problem and now the bug has
snuck into production. Luckily the application is written in Erlang so the
impact of the problem has been minimised, but I still need to fix the problem
as a matter of urgency.

---
class: center middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/time.png">
???

In this instance the problem was discovered just a few hours after I made the
mistake, so the change is still fresh in my mind and it's not too difficult to
correct it, but that's not always the case.

Depending on the culture of the company I'm working at it might take days or
weeks for a change to be deployed to production, or it might have taken longer
for the users to discover the problem.

Worse case scenario it has been months or years and the writer of the bug has
long since left the company, leaving me to try and fix code I've never seen
before.

---
class: center middle
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/science.png">
???

The larger the gap between the mistake being made and the problem being
detected the more difficult it will be to fix.

Of course this isn't the only factor in the difficulty, but it is an important
multiplier.

Erlang gives us powerful tools to tolerate mistakes and debug them, but they
largely only help us once the code is in production, and that time cost and
loss of familiarity is far from optimal.

---
class: minimal-padding middle center
<img class="color-adjust" src="img/bug-detected.png">
???

What I really want is to for problems to be detected here, immediately after the
mistake was made.

I want that feedback loop to be as fast as possible so we can spend less time
doing exploratory work (such as debugging) and more time iterating (actually
providing business value).

---
class: minimal-padding center middle
<img class="color-adjust" style="padding-bottom: 40px" src="img/ml-family.png">
???

Gleam aims to provide that fast and safe feedback loop by introducing a type
system inspired by those found in the ML family of languages.

Why these languages? Because I believe they are currently the languages that
do best at providing this rapid feedback loop.

Let's look at some examples:

---
## Reason

Messenger is Facebook's web chat program. It has 1.3 billion monthly users.

dialect of OCaml called Reason. A year later 50% of their code was written in
Reason and they had this to say:

This is not to say the engineers at NoRedInk and Facebook are without error,
they make as many mistakes as you or I.

before they get to production, or at least the ones that cause runtime errors.

# What's next for Gleam?

???

Gleam's a new language and there's many things still to come, so what's coming
up next?

---
class: xl-code
## Function arguments

```rust
version.matches(
  "3.0.3",
  "3.0",
  False,
)
```
???

With functions that take multiple argument it can be difficult to remember
what the arguments are and in which order they go.

This is especially true when a function has not very descriptive types, such
as this one that takes String, String, Bool


---
class: xl-code
## Labelled function arguments

```rust
version.matches(
  version: "3.0.3",
  requirement: "3.0",
  allow_pre: False,
)
```
???

The next version of Gleam will have labelled arguments, a popular feature from
languages such as Python and OCaml.

With this feature arguments can optionally have names at the call site, making
it clearer what they are and allowing them to be given in any order.

Sometimes in Erlang and Elixir we will give arguments in a map or a keyword
list to name arguments, but there is a small performance penalt to this.

Gleam's labelled arguments will be resolved entirely at compile time and have
no performance cost.


---
class: l-code center
## Exhaustiveness checking

```rust
enum Pet =
| Cat
| Dog
```

```rust
fn to_string(pet) {
  case pet {
  | Cat -> "kitty"
  | Dog -> "doggo"
  }
}
```

???

This feature is a personal favourite of mine and something that I'm really
looking forward to.

Let's say I've defined a Pet type in my codebase. It's an enum with 2
variants: Cat and Dog.

Elsewhere in my code I define a to_string function which pattern matches on a
pet and returns an appropriate string for each.

---
class: l-code center
## Exhaustiveness checking

```rust
enum Pet =
| Cat
| Dog
| Tamagotchi
```

```rust
fn to_string(pet) {
  case pet {
  | Cat -> "kitty"
  | Dog -> "doggo"
  }
}
```

???

Shortly afterward a new craze takes the nation by storm, an electronic pet
called a Tamagotchi. Not wanting to be left behind I add a Tamagotchi variant
to the Pet enum and ship my code to production.

Sadly I've forgotten to update the `to_string` function, so later when the
function is called with the Tamagotchi variant no clause matches causing the
process running the code to crash.

It's easy to see on this slide that the `to_string` function needs to be
updated, but in a codebase of tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code
it's hard to find all the places that need to be updated when a new variant is
added.

Once Gleam has exhaustiveness checking this kind of mistake will be
detected at compile time.

The compiler will halt and show the location of the problem and show what
patterns are missing, making this kind of error impossible.


---
## Editor integration

<img class="center-element" style="" src="img/editors.png">

???

Productivity is a core value for Gleam, and having good development tooling is
important for productivity.

We want the experience of writing Gleam code to be as slick and enjoyable as
possible, no matter what the editor the programmer is using. To achieve this
Gleam will implement Microsoft's Language Server Protocol.

Once implemented users of vim, emacs, atom, vs code and more will be able to
do the following:

- Display type errors in editor after every keystroke
- Provide code completion options for variables, modules, functions
- Show documentation and type information in the editor
- jump to the definition of functions and types
- Perform language aware renaming of variables, functions, and more with a
  single command
- format code automatically when saving a file, like with exfmt

And what's more thanks to Gleam's type system and static analysis this tooling
will be able to provide much richer information to the programmer than is
possible with other BEAM languages.

---
## Documentation
<img class="center-element" alt="documentation" style="" src="img/documentation.png">

???

Another part of the developer experience puzzle is documentation.

I don't know if anyone here has written a program in Gleam but right now it's
not as easy as it ought to be.

Unless you want to read the source code of any libraries you're using there's
no way to learn what modules and functions are available.

---
class: splash-image
<img src="img/hexdocs.png">
???

Meanwhile Elixir has the beautiful, searchable, mobile friendly documentation
generated from the code itself by the ex_doc tool, hosted on the hexdocs
website and linked directly to the hex package itself.

In Elixir it's easy to find the documentation you need, whether it's online,
in your editor, or on the command line, and we intend for this to be the case
for Gleam too.

Currently looking at whether we could use Elixir's ex_doc for Gleam.

## Exercism
<img class="center-element" style="max-width: 70%" src="img/exercism.png">

Exercism is a fantastic place for people to learn new programming languages
and to practice their coding skills.

---
class: middle

<img class="center-element" src="img/exercism-learn.png">

How does it work? A programmer picks a language they want to practice and
Exercism gives them an exercise to complete.

of unit tests to make pass.


---
class: middle

<img class="center-element" style="padding-top: 69px" src="img/exercism-chat.png">


???

Once the programmer has completed their solution they can to submit it back to
Exercism, where they get getting friendly and constructive feedback from track
mentors and other students.

They can also view solutions from other people and learn different approaches
to the same problem.


---

## 51 Languages and counting

<img class="center-element" src="img/exercism-languages.png">

???

Exercism currently has 51 live languages tracks and has given the thumbs up
for a Gleam track.

The exercises need to be ported to Gleam and documentation needs to be
written, but once done we'll have a top notch experience for learning and
practicing Gleam.

Exercism is community run, open source, and very well organised so if you're
interested in contributing to Gleam this could be a great place to create
help out.


---
## Typed OTP

```rust
pub struct Spec(arg, state, call, reply, cast) {
  init:
    fn(arg) -> Init(state)

  handle_call:
    fn(call, state) -> Call(reply, state)

  handle_cast:
    fn(cast, state) -> Cast(state)

  handle_info:
    fn(Any, state) -> Cast(state)
}

pub external fn start_link(Spec(a, b, c, d, e))
  -> Result(GenServer(b, c, d, e), InitError)
  = "gleam_gen_server" "start_link"
```
???

One question that is frequently asked is how does Gleam type processes and
OTP. The short answer is that it doesn't.

Gleam doesn't currently have any special first class support for processes or
OTP, instead these Erlang features are to be used via the Erlang FFI.

Today we have some simple bindings to `gen_server` that allow us to define and
use them in a type safe way, but we lack type safe bindings to other
behaviours such as supervisor.

The challenge here is how to write bindings that are reasonably safe but
flexible enough to support common Erlang patterns used today.

In future we could add some new features to Gleam that make it possible to
create better support for processes, but if we do I want these language
extensions to be generically useful rather than specific to processes.

Any new language extensions should be applicable to a wide variety of problems
and make the language more powerful as a whole.

# On the horizon

???

And on that note I'd like to share with you an idea for a future addition to
Gleam.

This is still very much in the early design stage so it may change quite a bit
before we come to add this to the language.


---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```elixir
defprotocol String.Chars do
  @spec to_string(t) :: String.t()
  def to_string(term)
end

defimpl String.Chars, for: Integer do
  def to_string(term) do
    Integer.to_string(term)
  end
end

defimpl String.Chars, for: Float do
  def to_string(term) do
    term |> :io_lib_format.fwrite_g() |> IO.iodata_to_binary()
  end
end
```
???

Today all functions in Gleam are monomorphic, it's not possible to write a
function that takes a list OR a map.

Another problem is that we can't take a function (behaviour) from a library
and make it work with types that we have defined. If someone writes a function
that takes a list we can't give it a new vector type that we have implemented,
even if conceptually a vector would work OK for what the function does.

Elixir solves this with protocols.

For example, Elixir's String.Char protocol allows the `to_string` function to
work on Lists, Atoms, Ints, Floats and more.

If we want the `to_string` function to work on new types that we have created
we can implement the protocol for that type.

---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```rust
pub trait ToString {
  fn to_string(Self) -> String
}

let Int: ToString {
  fn to_string(term) {
    int.to_string(term)
  }
}


let Float: ToString {
  fn to_string(term) {
    term |> fwrite_g |> iodata.to_string
  }
}
```
???

Here's what the same protocol may look like in Gleam, though right now we're
calling them traits.

It's similar in that there's a definition for the `ToString` trait and two
implementations, and now the `to_string` function can be used on either `Ints`
or `Floats`.

What's different is how the language dispatches to the correct implementation
for a given type.

Elixir inspects the value at runtime, which is why Elixir's protocols can only
be defined for structs and a few special types. It is not possible to
implement a protocol for types that have the same runtime representation.

For example, it is not possible to have an implementation for an Erlang record
and another for a queue, as both are tuples at runtime.

Gleam's traits instead will dispatch using type information, so a trait can be
implemented for two types even if they have the same runtime representation.


---
## Ad hoc polymorphism

```rust
pub trait Default {
  fn default() -> Self
}

let Int: Default {
  fn default(s) {
    0
  }
}


let Float: Default {
  fn default(s) {
    0.0
  }
}
```
???

Another cool thing about dispatching using type information is that Gleam can
dispatch based upon a return type rather than just the argument, as is the
case in this `default` function.

This wouldn't be possible to implement in Elixir's protocols as we need a
value to find the implementation to use, but the only way to obtain a value is
to invoke the correct implementation.

We have a chicken and egg problem.

This is however possible if we dispatch using type information

This type based polymorphism has much more expressive power and I think we
could find many exciting uses for a system like this.
